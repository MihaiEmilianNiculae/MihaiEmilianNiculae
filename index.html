                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>In the small village of Blejoi, nestled in a quiet part of Romania, my journey began. From a young age, I was captivated by the intricate workings of the world around me—a curiosity that sparked a lifelong passion for learning. Little did I know that this passion would lead me on a remarkable path towards educational leadership, shaped by pivotal experiences and transformative moments that would define my future.</p>
                <p>One of my most cherished childhood memories is a trip to London with my two older sisters. As we navigated the bustling streets adorned with sparkling lights, I was swept away by the city’s vibrant energy and rich tapestry of history. It was during this visit that I unknowingly laid the groundwork for my future home. The winding streets and iconic landmarks ignited a passion for exploration and discovery, planting seeds of ambition that would flourish in the years to come. London's dynamic spirit and cultural diversity made a lasting impression on me, shaping my dreams and aspirations.</p>
                <p>The autumn of 2017 marked a significant turning point in my life. Inspired by my English language teacher, I decided to run for president of the student body at my local school. Winning this election was more than a personal achievement; it opened a gateway to new opportunities. In this role, I led initiatives that intertwined environmental stewardship with sports, fostering both physical health and a collective environmental consciousness among my peers. Our efforts culminated in vibrant festivals, from Romanian National Day to the Festival of International Education in Ploiești, each event a testament to our community's spirit and academic excellence.</p>
                <p>The following year brought another exciting chapter as I was elected Mayor through the innovative "Local Council of Children" project. This role expanded my responsibilities, allowing me to lead a delegation of students to the Romanian parliament, where we engaged with senators and gained invaluable insights into the machinery of democracy. This experience deepened my understanding of civic responsibility and the power of young voices to shape the future. None of this would have been possible without the support of my Romanian teachers, who played a pivotal part in my development as a young person.</p>
                <p>At that time, my aspirations leaned towards a career in politics, driven by a desire to make meaningful changes in society. However, life had other plans for me. In September 2018, I relocated to Northampton to attend Abbeyfield School, stepping into a new world of academic possibilities. The transition to an English-speaking environment was daunting, with its linguistic nuances and unfamiliar educational framework. Yet, the resilience I had cultivated through my leadership roles in Romania equipped me to embrace these challenges with determination and enthusiasm.</p>
                <p>From my first day in the British school system, I was fortunate to be welcomed by the school’s friendly EAL coordinator. Her kindness played a crucial role in my adjustment, offering friendship and guidance that I cherish to this day. We spent countless hours discussing topics ranging from politics to science and even music, enriching my experience and easing my transition. Her support was instrumental in helping me adapt to my new surroundings and fully engage with the curriculum.</p>
                <p>My first class in the British education system was a mathematics class. At that time, maths was one of my biggest fears, and like many teenagers, I dreaded it. However, as I stepped into the classroom, my perception began to change. My mathematics teacher welcomed us with the song “September” by Earth, Wind & Fire playing in the background, her vibrant smile instantly making the room feel warm and inviting. She moved me between classes to test my level, and by the end of secondary school, I had studied under four different teachers, each of whom played an important role in changing my views towards maths.</p>
                <p>This newfound passion for mathematics led me to establish a peer tutoring programme, helping other international students bridge cultural and educational gaps. As my high school years progressed, my focus shifted from politics to mathematics, a transformation that felt as natural as the changing seasons. Although I faced a setback when I couldn't enrol in the further mathematics class due to space constraints, I was undeterred. I took it upon myself to study Further Mathematics independently and enrolled at a neighbouring school to broaden my analytical skills.</p>
                <p>During my high school years, I studied English Literature, psychology, mathematics, further mathematics, and computer science, each subject broadening my understanding of the world. I treasured my time in high school as my love for mathematics flourished. I had the opportunity to learn different aspects of pure mathematics, mechanics, and statistics from multiple teachers, each bringing unique insights to the subject. Statistics, however, was not my favourite at the time, and my statistics teacher was well aware of this. I was constantly asking questions, often pestering him during break times—I’m sure he was relieved when I finally finished high school! Ironically, despite my initial reluctance, I am now about to specialise in statistics and data. I even wrote a revision guide for mathematics as one of my final extended projects. This period of self-directed learning and exploration was pivotal, laying the foundation for my future academic pursuits.</p>
                <p>During this time, I immersed myself in the rich literature of mathematics, discovering that it was not just about numbers but about understanding life’s very foundation. I realised that mathematics is woven into the fabric of everything, from the structure of narratives in English literature to the statistical methods used in psychology. This exploration extended beyond the classroom, as I engaged in practical applications during UCL Science Week and as a delegate in the European Youth Parliament. Whether discussing the critical role of bees in our ecosystem or the precision required in space engineering, each experience underscored the pervasive influence of mathematics.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of high school, I found myself drafting my personal statement for a mathematics degree, a testament to my journey and passion. My class tutor praised my first draft as perfect for university submission, a validation of the path I had chosen. Choosing a university was a challenging and competitive process, but ultimately, I was captivated by the University of Greenwich. Its stunning architecture, deeply rooted in mathematical principles, and the lecturers’ passion for the subject resonated with me. Everything felt perfect—the campus’s design, the expert-led lectures, and the vibrant community convinced me that Greenwich was the ideal place for my academic and personal growth.</p>
                <p>During my first year at university, I covered modules in Vectors and Matrices, Mathematical Coding, Calculus and Mathematical Analysis, Discrete Mathematics, Analysis of Data, and Probability and Randomness. I spent countless hours in the university library, delving deeper into the depths of each module. My favourite modules were Vectors and Matrices, where I learned to use them to project movies and understand financial markets, and Analysis of Data, which showed me how powerful data is in our world and how it acts as a dialect of mathematics. This rigorous academic environment fostered my love for mathematics and nurtured my intellectual curiosity.</p>
                <p>During this time, I also started to tutor and, by the end of my second year, had managed to tutor over 250 students in mathematics and sciences, from primary school to adult learners. This experience was incredibly rewarding and allowed me to develop my teaching skills and share my passion for mathematics with others.</p>
                <p>I revived the mathematics society as its president, organising workshops to bridge the gaps between high school and university. We hosted magic workshops and movie nights to make learning fun and engaging. These initiatives not only enriched the university experience for many students but also fostered a sense of community and collaboration among our peers.</p>
                <p>In my second year, I deepened my understanding of data and statistics, knowing this would be my focus for the final year. I also became a private examiner for both private and public schools, marking thousands of papers and analysing trends in grades based on question difficulties. This role allowed me to gain valuable insights into analysing data and develop a keen understanding of assessment practices.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of my second year, I passed the presidency of the mathematics society to new students and hosted the first-ever mathematics summit with all London universities—a collaborative effort that marked a new chapter in the society’s history. This summit brought together students and academics from across the city, fostering connections and sparking innovative discussions on the future of mathematics.</p>
                <p>Currently, in my third year, I am studying modules in Actuarial Mathematics and Risk Modelling, Mathematics for the Life Sciences, Machine Learning, Modelling and Analysis of Financial Instruments, Financial Time Series, and Linear Models and Statistical Inference. These subjects are equipping me with the skills and knowledge to navigate the complexities of the modern world. The diverse curriculum has broadened my perspective and prepared me for the challenges of the professional realm.</p>
                <p>Reflecting on my journey from the small village of Blejoi to the vibrant city of London, I see a tapestry woven with experiences, challenges, and revelations. It is a story of transformation, fuelled by a love for learning and a deepening appreciation for mathematics. Through it all, I've learned that life can change in the most unexpected ways, guiding us towards paths we never imagined, filled with opportunities to discover new passions and redefine our destinies. Now, as I stand on the brink of graduation with a degree in mathematics, I am ready to leap into the world beyond academia. Stay tuned for the next chapter of my adventure—where numbers continue to tell stories, and every equation holds the promise of discovery.</p>
